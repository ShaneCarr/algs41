// better makes an effort to walk up the tree for reas in an effecient manner by walking the relevant nodes.
// makes the tree ballanced because it always inserts the smaller tree below the larger tree. 
// note because the larger tree must be greater than or equal the number of nodes in the tree you are adding. 
// depth increases by 1 when its tree is merged into another tree we only do that if t2 is bigger than x's tree t1. so if the x increases it at least doubles.
// if it doubles and only has n elements lg N is the max it can double. 
// note max(depth) <= lg N for testing.
/*
 * when does x's depth increas
 * when x's tree is merged niot another. we oly do that when we are merging into a new tree, which is at least teh size of teh current. so ti is doubling each time, at least. Lg n is max height.
